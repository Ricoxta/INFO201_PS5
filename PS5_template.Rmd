# Disclaimer: this serves as a template for you to compose your answer for PS4. It is 100% hardcoded, so error may exists. Please refer to the official spec for a full list of questions and requirements.

# Instructions
This is a problem set about rmarkdown and plotting (using ggplot). Unlike the previous problem sets, this one does not give you a ready-made GH repo with a code file–it is now your task to create a repo and include your rmarkdown file in there.\

You should answer the questions below in that file, knit it, and submit both the compiled html and link to your repo on canvas.\

- This problem sets asks you to write extensively when commenting your results. Please write clearly! Answer questions in a way that if the code chunks are hidden then the result is still readable! \
    * All substantial questions need explanations. You do not have to explain the simple things like “how many rows are there in data”, but if you make a plot of life expectancy, then you should explain what does the plot tell you. \
    * Write explanations as markdown and use the styles like bold and italic as appropriate.\
- Do not print too much results. It is all well to print a few lines of data for evaluation/demonstration purposes. But do not print dozens (or thousands!) of lines–no one bothers to look at that many numbers. You will lose points for annoying others (here your graders, but later potentially your boss). \
- Do not make code lines too long. 80-100 characters is a good choice. Your grader may not be able to follow all the code if the line is too long–most of us are using small laptop screens! (And again–you want to keep your graders happy!) \

# 1 Load and check data (5pt)
You first task is to do a very simple data check: 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

1. (1pt) For solving the problems, and answering the questions, create a new rmarkdown document with an appropriate title. See [**https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/r-markdown.html#r-markdown-rstudio-creating**](https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/r-markdown.html#r-markdown-rstudio-creating). \


2. (2pt) Load data. How many rows/columns do we have?  \
```{r}
gapminder <- read_delim("gapminder.csv.bz2")
```

There are `r nrow(gapminder)` rows and `r ncol(gapminder)` columns in the data frame.

3. (2pt) Print a small sample of data. Does it look OK? 
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  head(6)
```
  
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------


# 2 Descriptive statistics (15pt)

1. (3pt) How many countries are there in the dataset? Analyze all three: *iso3*, *iso2* and *name*.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  summarise(ctry2l = n_distinct(iso2),
         ctry3l = n_distinct(iso3),
         ctry_name = n_distinct(name))
```


2. If you did this correctly, you saw that there are more iso-2 codes than names, and there are even more *iso3*-codes. What is going on? Can you find it out?

    (a) (5pt) Find how many names are there for each iso-2 code. Are there any iso-2 codes that correspond to more than one name? What are these countries?
    
```{r}
gapminder %>%
 group_by(iso2) %>%
 summarise(c_name = n_distinct(name)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(c_name))

```
    
    
    (b) (5pt) Now repeat the same for name and iso3-code. Are there country names that have more than one iso3-code? What are these countries? Hint: two of these entitites are *CHANISL* and *NLD CURACAO*.
    ```{r}
gapminder %>%
      group_by(name) %>% 
      summarise(n_iso3 = n_distinct(iso3)) %>% 
      arrange(desc(n_iso3))

```
3. (2pt) What is the minimum and maximum year in these data?

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3 CO2 emissions (30pt)
Next, let’s analyze CO2 emissions.

1. (2pt) How many missing co2 emissions are there for each year? Analyze both missing *CO2* and *co2_PC*. Which years have most missing data? \

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarise(count_co2 = sum(is.na(co2)), count_co2_PC = sum(is.na(co2_PC))) %>% 
  filter(rank(desc(count_co2)) < 6) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_co2))
  
  
```

The years that have the most amount of missing data for CO2 and co2_PC are 2017, 2018, and 2019.

2. (5pt) Make a plot of total CO2 emissions over time for the U.S, China, and India. Add a few more countries of your choice. Explain what do you see. \

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(name == c("United States of America", "China", "India", "Indonesia", "Maldives")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(co2), !is.na(co2_PC)) %>% 
  mutate(total = (co2 + co2_PC)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time, total, col = name)) + 
  geom_line()+
  labs(x = "Time(years)", y = "Total Emissions", col = "Country Name")
  
```

What I saw was that after the year 2000, China's CO2 emissions increased at a higher rate than all of the other countries that were plotted on the graph. \


3. (5pt) Now let’s analyze the CO2 emissions per capita (*co2_PC*). Make a similar plot of the same countries. What does this figure suggest? \

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
 filter(name == c("United States of America", "China", "India", "Indonesia", "Maldives")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(co2_PC)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time, co2_PC, col = name)) + 
  geom_line()+
  labs(x = "Time(years)", y = "Emissions per Capita", col = "Country Name")
  
```

The plot shows that the United States had a higher amount of emissions per capita compared to all of the other countries in the graph. The US may have more services or products that use more CO2 than other countries such as for transportation like cars. 


4. (6pt) Compute average CO2 emissions per capita across the continents (assume *region* is the same as continent). Comment what do you see. \
Note: just compute averages over countries and ignore the fact that countries are of different size. \
Hint: Americas 2016 should be 4.80. \

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(!is.na(co2_PC), !is.na(region)) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(co2_PC)) %>% 
  select(region, avg)
```

Something that I see in the data is that Europe has the highest average amount of CO2 emissions compared to the rest of the regions in the dataset.


5. (7pt) Make a barplot where you show the previous results–average CO2 emissions per capita across continents in 1960 and 2016. \
Hint: it should look something along these lines(**Please refer to the spec for the graph**) \

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(!is.na(co2_PC), !is.na(region)) %>%
  filter(time == 1960 | time == 2016) %>% 
  group_by(time, region) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(co2_PC)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(region, avg,  fill = factor(time))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")+
  labs(x = "region", y = "Average CO2 Emissions per Capita", fill = "Year")
 
```


6. Which countries are the three largest, and three smallest CO2 emitters (in terms of CO2 per capita) in 2016 for each continent? (Assume *region* is continent). \

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(co2_PC), !is.na(region)) %>%
  filter(time == 2016)  %>% 
  filter(rank(desc(co2_PC)) <=3 |rank(co2_PC) <= 3) %>% 
  arrange(region, desc(co2_PC)) %>% 
  select(name, region, co2_PC)
  
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4 GDP per capita (50pt)
Let’s look at GDP per capita (*GDP_PC*)

1. (8pt) Make a scatterplot of GDP per capita versus life expectancy by country, using data for 1960. Make the point size dependent on the country size, and color those according to the continent. Feel free to adjust the plot in other ways to make it better. \
Comment what do you see there. \

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(name) %>% 
  filter(time == 1960,
         !is.na(lifeExpectancy),
         !is.na(GDP_PC)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lifeExpectancy, GDP_PC, size = totalPopulation, col = region))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "LIfe Expectancy(years)",
       y = "GDP per Capita",
       size = "Population Size",
       col = "Region",
       title = "GDP of countries vs Life Expectancy")
```


I see that life expectancy increases, the GDP of that country is also higher. Countries with low life expectancy have low GDP per capita.


2. (4pt) Make a similar plot, but this time use 2019 data only. \

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(name) %>% 
  filter(time == 2019,
         !is.na(lifeExpectancy),
         !is.na(GDP_PC),
         !is.na(region)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lifeExpectancy, GDP_PC, size = totalPopulation, col = region))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "LIfe Expectancy(years)",
       y = "GDP per Capita",
       size = "Population Size",
       col = "Region",
       title = "GDP of countries vs Life Expectancy")
```

3. (6pt) Compare these two plots and comment what do you see. How has world developed through the last 60 years? \

**The world has developed in a way that allows for countries to have a higher life expectancy. The GDP of regions like the Americas has gone down as well even though they have a higher life expectancy. The GDP for a lot of regions like Africa and Asia have stayed low over the last 60 years. **

4. (6pt) Compute the average life expectancy for each continent in 1960 and 2019. Do the results fit with what do you see on the figures? \
Note: here as *average*I mean just average over countries, ignore the fact that countries are of different size.\

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(region, time) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region), !is.na(lifeExpectancy),
         time == 1960 | time == 2019) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(lifeExpectancy))
```

**The results do fit in with the figure since Europe has the highest average life expectancy in the table as well as in the plot. Also, all of the countries have increased in life expectancy as well over the years so the results fit the figures in that way too.**

5. (8pt) Compute the average LE growth from 1960-2019 across the continents. Show the results in the order of growth. Explain what do you see. \
Hint: these data (data in long form) is not the simplest to compute growth. But you may want to check out the lag() function. And do not forget to group data by continent when using lag(), otherwise your results will be messed up! See [**https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/dplyr.html#dplyr-helpers-compute**](https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/dplyr.html#dplyr-helpers-compute).\
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  filter(time == 1960 | time == 2019,
         !is.na(region),
         !is.na(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  arrange(time) %>% 
  summarise(avg_LE = mean(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  mutate(prev = lag(avg_LE, default = 0), 
         growth = avg_LE - prev) %>% 
  select(region, avg_LE, prev, growth )

  
```

**I see that Africa had the most amount of growth in avergae life expectancy and that some of the life expectancy decreased from 1960 and 2019 like Asia and Oceania.**

6. (6pt) Show the histogram of GDP per capita for years of 1960 and 2019. Try to put both histograms on the same graph, see how well you can do it! \

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  filter(time == 1960 | time == 2019,
         !is.na(GDP_PC)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = GDP_PC, fill = factor(time)))+
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", bins = 30)
```


7. (6pt) What was the ranking of US in terms of life expectancy in 1960 and in 2019? (When counting from top.) \
Hint: check out the function rank()! \
Hint2: 17 for 1960. \
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(time == 1960,
         !is.na(lifeExpectancy),
         !is.na(name)) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(lifeExpectancy))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  select(rank, name, lifeExpectancy) %>% 
  filter(name == "United States of America")

```
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(time == 2019,
         !is.na(lifeExpectancy),
         !is.na(name)) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(lifeExpectancy))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
    select(rank, name, lifeExpectancy) %>%
  filter(name == "United States of America")
  
```


8. (6pt) If you did this correctly, then you noticed that US ranking has been falling quite a bit. But we also have more countries in 2019–what about the relative rank divided by the corresponding number of countries that have LE data in the corresponding year? \
Hint: 0.0904 for 1960. \


```{r}
  
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  filter(time == 1960 | time ==2019,
         !is.na(lifeExpectancy),
         !is.na(name)) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(lifeExpectancy)), countries = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
    filter(name == "United States of America") %>% 
  summarise(relative_rank_le = rank/countries) 

  
  
```

Finally tell us how many hours did you spend on this PS.

I have spent around 12 hours working on this PS
